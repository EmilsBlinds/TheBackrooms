# The Backrooms

### A horror escape the room game

Your goal is to find a way out of the place you're trapped in, (e.g. find key and then an exit door), while evading the evil entity that's chasing you.

The evil entities will emit a ambient sound, by which you can tell how close it is to you, if it catches you, the game ends.

Pressing _Shift_ will make you run, but you have a stamina bar which you have to keep in check.

There are a total of 3 levels, each level increases with difficulty, making both the map harder to complete, and adding a new entity to chase you.

## Planned future features

* Updated entities
* More detailed maps
* New levels
* Inventory UI to store items
* A flashlight that runs on battery
